This little R Notebok serves the purpose of simplifying the process of data generation.

The whole point is to just build functions that take in parameters like types of distributions and according parametrization of the specific distributions to generate a random sample for simulation and theoretical analysis.

Specifically, the following hyperparameters are to be considered

- Type of distribution:
  - Normal
  - Gamma
  - T-Student
  - Chi2
- Parametrisation:
  - Mean
  - Variance
- Upper and lower bound


```{r}

# Simple Function that generates some uniform RNs within a lower and upper bound
# Additionally performing a stock plot of the data
# Generated variable In global environment for further use


UnG <- function(Number,Lower,Upper) {

  Raw_data = runif(Number,Lower,Upper)
  Generated <<- as.array(Raw_data)
  hist(Generated)
}
```


```{r}
# Example
UnG(1000,1,10)
```
